# PoolApp
React Native application for calculating pool scores, currently only for 14.1 discipline.

## Installation
Clone from github
```git clone https://github.com/ottopaaso/poolapp.git```
Install node modules (beware, there will be a lot to download and install)
```npm install```
Voila!

## Executing tests
Tests are run using mocha runner (mocha is brought as dev dependency):
```npm run test```

## Next steps

Implement the UI. There is nothing as of now.
Most likely will have to change getting turn results to be promises.

## Ideas

Typescript would help the overall code health.
